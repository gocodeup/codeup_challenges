# Word Counter

Tool to find the 10 most commonly used words in a document.

## Command line

This tool works on the command line. You can pass a text file as an argument, and the file will output the most common words via the CLI.

Output should include total word count, and the 10 most frequently used words with each word's percentage of overall use.

*Bonus:* allow minimum word length for top 10. Example: only show words longer than 3 letters.
